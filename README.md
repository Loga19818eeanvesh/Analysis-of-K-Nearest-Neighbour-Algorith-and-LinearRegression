# Analysis of K Nearest Neighbour Algorith and LinearRegression

## Machine Learning Course Project.

-Implemented both KNN Algoritm and LinearRegression in TensorFlow.js
-Also Implemented both Algorithms without using any Libraries in JavaScript 

-Used KNN Algorith to predict the box into which ball falls in plinko game. Analysed for different values of k and for different features. Got optimised result for k of 10 and for feature "drop position".

-Used Linear regression to predict mileage of car. Analysed for different features and got optimised result for features "horsepower, weight, displacement". Plotted graphs of Mean square error vs features.
